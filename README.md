## Reflection

I was looking forward to really honing my OOP design skills with this project and I came to learn how much I don't know about what I don't know re: OOP. The computer algorithim was a particular challenge and at one point I had to take a step away from this program and come back to it with a fresh mind. I enventually solved the algorithim problem and reinforcd to myself the importance of persverance.
